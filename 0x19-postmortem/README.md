Issue Summary:
Duration: May 15, 2023, from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM EDT
Impact: Users were unable to access the website, experiencing error messages and slow loading times. Approximately 80% of users were affected.
Root cause: A software bug in the backend code caused a bottleneck in the database, leading to server overload and eventual website outage.

Timeline:
- 10:00 AM - The outage was detected by the monitoring system, which alerted the on-call engineer.
- 10:05 AM - The engineer investigated the system logs and identified a sudden spike in database queries.
- 10:10 AM - The engineer hypothesized that the issue was caused by a database error and began analyzing the codebase.
- 10:20 AM - A senior developer joined the investigation and reviewed the code, identifying a loop in the backend code that was causing excessive database queries.
- 10:30 AM - The team attempted to fix the issue by disabling the faulty code, but the website remained slow and unresponsive.
- 10:45 AM - The team realized that the database had reached its capacity and attempted to offload some of the data to a backup server.
- 11:00 AM - The website was restored to normal functioning.

Root cause and resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a software bug that caused a bottleneck in the database by creating an infinite loop of database queries. To fix the issue, the team had to disable the faulty code and offload some of the data to a backup server to reduce the load on the primary database. Once these actions were taken, the website was restored to normal functioning.

Corrective and preventative measures:
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the team will implement the following corrective and preventative measures:
- Conduct a code review to identify any other instances of inefficient database queries
- Increase database capacity to handle unexpected traffic spikes
- Implement more robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect potential issues before they become critical
- Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to minimize downtime in the event of future outages
- Provide additional training for developers and engineers on best practices for optimizing database performance.
